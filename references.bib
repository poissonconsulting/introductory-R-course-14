	abstract = {Bayesian statistics has exploded into biology and its sub-disciplines such as ecology over the past decade. The free software program {WinBUGS} and its open-source sister {OpenBugs} is currently the only flexible and general-purpose program available with which the average ecologist can conduct their own standard and non-standard Bayesian statistics. Introduction to {WINBUGS} for Ecologists goes right to the heart of the matter by providing ecologists with a comprehensive, yet concise, guide to applying {WinBUGS} to the types of models that they use most often: linear ({LM)}, generalized linear ({GLM)}, linear mixed ({LMM)} and generalized linear mixed models ({GLMM).} Introduction to {WinBUGS} for Ecologists combines the use of simulated data sets "paired" analyses using {WinBUGS} (in a Bayesian framework for analysis) and in R (in a frequentist mode of inference) and uses a very detailed step-by-step tutorial presentation style that really lets the reader repeat every step of the application of a given mode in their own research. - Introduction to the essential theories of key models used by ecologists - Complete juxtaposition of classical analyses in R and Bayesian Analysis of the same models in {WinBUGS} - Provides every detail of R and {WinBUGS} code required to conduct all analyses - Written with ecological language and ecological examples - Companion Web Appendix that contains all code contained in the book, additional material (including more code and solutions to exercises) - Tutorial approach shows ecologists how to implement Bayesian analysis in practical problems that they face.},
